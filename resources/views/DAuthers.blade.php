                            <h4>Reporting standards</h4>

                            <p>Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of the
                                work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying
                                data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain
                                sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent
                                or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behavior and are
                                unacceptable.

                            <p>Authors are asked to provide the raw data in connection with a paper for
                                editorial review, and should be prepared to provide public access if
                                practicable, and should in any event be prepared to retain such data for a
                                reasonable time after publication.

                            <p>An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially
                                the same research in more than one journal or primary publication.
                                Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently
                                constitutes unethical publishingbehaviour and is unacceptable. Duplicate
                                publication is a publication that overlaps substantially with one already
                                published, in press, or in an electronic media submission. Redundant
                                submission is the same manuscript that is submitted to different journals at
                                the same time. International copyright laws, ethical conduct, and cost
                                effective use of resources require that readers can be assured that what
                                they are reading is original. Submitted manuscripts should not have been
                                published or currently submitted elsewhere. Duplicate publication is a
                                violation of the APA code of ethics by APA Publication Manual, 2010 and will
                                be grounds for prompt rejection of the submitted manuscript. If the editor
                                was not aware of the violation and the article has been published, a notice
                                of duplicate submission and the ethical violation will be published.
