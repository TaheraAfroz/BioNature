                                        Your highlights are the first thing about your paper that anyone online will

                                            <h4>Bionature</h4>
                                            <p> The text should be subdivided into Introduction, Materials and
                                                methods, Results and discussion, and Conclusions. General points for
                                                authors
                                                to consider include:<br>
                                                1. Please ensure that your manuscript has been spell-checked and
                                                grammar-checked before submission to remove trivial errors.<br>
                                                2. Papers should be written in either American or British English but
                                                must
                                                be consistent throughout the paper-do not use both in the same
                                                paper.<br>
                                                3. Abbreviations and acronyms should be used sparingly and consistently.
                                                When they first appear in the text, the complete term should be given,
                                                e.g.
                                                DMF = dimethylformamide.<br>
                                                4. Use only symbol and normal text character sets when inserting Greek
                                                letters (a), German umlauts (ä), accents (é) etc.<br>
                                                5. All scientific units must be preceded by a space, for example: ‘...
                                                for
                                                2.5 h at 50 °C’ not ‘... for 2.5h at 50°C’.<br>
                                                6. Use tab stops for indents not the space bar.<br>
                                                7. Use the table function and not spreadsheets to create tables.<br>
                                                8. Use the equation editor or an equivalent for equations. For authors
                                                using
                                                Word 2007 or later use the Microsoft equation editor rather than the
                                                default
                                                editor.<br>

                                                numerals with a caption written in normal text. For example: ‘Table 3
                                                Characterization data for complexes 1-3.’ The table must also be cited

                                                and
                                                illustrations should be placed on separate pages or in the text and
                                                numbered
                                                using Arabic numerals. As with tables the figure captions must be
                                                written in
                                                normal text and must be cited in the text. Other points to consider
                                                include:<br>
                                                1. Figure cations should be written Figure 1 Text.<br>
                                                2. The graphics must be submitted as *.jpg or *.tif files.<br>
                                                3. They must have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi for good
                                                reproduction.<br>
                                                4. Images from other authors’ work must be properly referenced.<br>
                                                5. Figures containing text must have the text embedded in the figure
                                                file.<br>
                                                6. Use simple fonts such as Arial for text in the figure.<br>
                                                7. Do not use faint lines and check that all fonts are legible at final
                                                size.<br>
                                                8. Try to avoid colour graphs, charts and lines as these are often not
                                                distinguishable when printed in black and white.<br>
